|*  Commands will be performed on a server by  *|
|*  using their alias as a command. You can    *|
|*  find your servers id by checking the URL   *|
|*  while looking at it's console.             *|
|*  Maineiac should link to the proper page    *|
|*  here. If he hasn't, tell him to.           *|
|*                                             *|  
|*  Example :                                  *|
|*    https://your.panel.gg/server/a2e56ffz    *|
|*                            ID = a2e56ffz    *|
|*                                             *|
|*  You can also find it by just looking at    *|
|*  the WISP index (client panel, not the a    *|
|*  admin panel) It's called the "UUID"        *|
|*                                             *|
|*  If your server is a gmod darkrp server and *|
|*  it's id is a2e56ffz your alias would look  *|
|*  something like this :                      *|
|*      darkrp: "a2e56ffz"                     *|
|*  If you have more servers you can add them. *|
|*  This doesn't have a cap.                   *|
|*  Just add a comma at the end of each one.   *|
|*                                             *|
|*  Example :                                  *|
|*      darkrp: "a2e56ffz",                    *|
|*      ttt: "c2r88cz5"                        *|
